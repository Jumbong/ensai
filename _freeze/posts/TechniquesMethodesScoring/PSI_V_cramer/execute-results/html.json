In this case, we can use the population stability index(PSI) and CRAMER's V to assess the representativeness between the two databases. This document will be divided into three parts. In the first part, I will explain how the PSI works. In the second part of your explain how Cramer's V works. Finally, I will guide you through how implementing PSI and Cramer's V in Python using real data. \n\n## Population Stability Index (PSI).\n\nWe can define the PSI As a measure of how much a population have shifted over time, or between two different samples of a population (e.g., training and test data). In the case of two different samples of a population , the training and the test set, the PSI can be calculated as follows: \n$$\nPSI = \\sum_{bucket} (P_{train} - P_{test}) \\times \\log(\\frac{P_{train}}{P_{test}})\n$$\nwhere $P_{train}$ and $P_{test}$ are the proportion of the population in each bucket for the training and test set, respectively. \n\n## CRAMER's V\n\nThe Cramer's V test it is goodness of fit test applied to binned data. Continuous knows that time must be bind into a fixed number of buckets. This number should be determined statically using clustering methodology. The segmentation defined must be propagated on all the historical data.\n\nThe Cramer's V Consider the size of the portfolios and the number of classes, there is a link between $\\chi^2$ statistics and Cramer's V:\n$$\nV = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\chi^2}{n \\times (min(c, r) - 1)}}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the number of columns, $r$ is the number of rows, and $n$ is the total number of observations. \n\nConsidering a simple. using the binned value of a variable in the training set and binned value of the same variable in the test set using the same segmentation. We will use the value of the Cramer's V statistic.\n- If the value is low. It's mean there's no link between the variable and the belonging to the training or test set.\n- If the value is high, they say link between the variable and the belonging to the training or test set.\n\n## Implementation\n\nBefore implementing. ensure that you have done the same The same treatment in the test set as you have done in the training set. \n\n",
